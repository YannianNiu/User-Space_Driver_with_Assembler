# User-Space_Driver
A user-space driver forwarding test (for Ubuntu and Intel 82545 NIC or VMware Workstation)

One of the corresponding paper "Throughput-Efficient Communication Device Driver for IoT Gateways" has been accepted by 2022 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics(SMC). The other one of the paper "Assembler: A Throughput-Efficient Module for Network Driver of Edge Computing Gateways" has been accepted by the 23rd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS). However, both of them are not yet searchable on Xplore, please wait for a moment.

We thanks the authors of paper "User Space Network Drivers" and the authors of paper "PostMan: Rapidly Mitigating Bursty Traffic by Offloading Packet Processing" for their inspiration in writing our papers.
